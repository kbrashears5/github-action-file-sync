# Use Cases
Great for keeping your files in sync across multiple repositories. A good use case for me was the `.github/dependabot.yml` files.

I have a master repo where these are synced from, and then they are kept in sync with the master repository.

If I need to make a change, rather than go make a change x many times across all my repositories, I make the change once, and on push to the master repository, all my child repositories are updated. 

Another example is if you're creating new Github Actions for a repository, you can make them once, check them into master repository, and then deploy them all across all your repositories all at once. 

This also isn't limited to Github Action yaml files - another use case could be keeping the `.editorconfig`, `LICENSE`, `tsconfig.json`, `eslintrc.yml`, `.gitignore`, `azure-pieplines.yml`, etc. in sync across all your repositories.

If I have a file that gets out of sync for whatever reason, the cron side of the `on` will take care of putting it back in sync with the master repository.

See my [master sync repo](https://github.com/kbrashears5/kbrashears5) for examples on how I use it across all my repositories.

# Setup
Create a new file called `/.github/workflows/file-sync.yml` that looks like so:
```yaml
name: File Sync

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  schedule:
    - cron: 0 0 * * *

jobs:
  file_sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Fetching Local Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: File Sync
        uses: kbrashears5/github-action-file-sync@v2.0.0
        with:
          REPOSITORIES: |
            username/repo@master
          FILES: |
            sync/dependabot.yml=.github/dependabot.yml
          TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ACTIONS }}
```
## Parameters
| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| REPOSITORIES | true | List of repositories to sync the files to. Optionally provide branch name |
| FILES | true | List of files to sync across repositories. See below for details |
| PULL_REQUEST_BRANCH_NAME | false | Branch name of branch to do pull request into. Default is no pull request opened |
| GIT_EMAIL | false | Git email to use |
| GIT_USERNAME | false | Git username to use |
| TOKEN | true | Personal Access Token with repo scope, and workflow scope if managing Actions-related files |

## Examples
### REPOSITORIES parameter
Push to the `master` branch
```yaml
REPOSITORIES: |
    username/repo
```
Push to the `dev` branch
```yaml
REPOSITORIES: |
    username/repo@dev
```
### FILES parameter

<u>File sync</u>

Root file with root destination
```yaml
FILES: |
    dependabot.yml
```
Root file with new destination
```yaml
FILES: |
    dependabot.yml=.github/dependabot.yml
```
Nested file with same nested file structure destination
```yaml
FILES: |
    .github/dependabot.yml
```
Nested file with new destination
```yaml
FILES: |
    sync/dependabot.yml=.github/dependabot.yml
```

<u>Folder Sync</u>

Root folder to root directory
```yaml
FILES: |
    sync
```
Root folder with new directory
```yaml
FILES: |
    sync/=newFolderName/
```
### PULL_REQUEST_BRANCH_NAME parameter
Specify branch name to create pull request against
```yaml
PULL_REQUEST_BRANCH_NAME: main
```

### TOKEN parameter
Use the repository secret named `ACTIONS`
```yaml
TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ACTIONS }}
```

## Troubleshooting
### Spacing
Spacing around the equal sign is important. For example, this will not work:
```yaml
FILES: |
  folder/file-sync.yml = folder/test.txt
```
It passes to the shell file 3 distinct objects
- folder/file-sync.ymll
- =
- folder/test.txt

instead of 1 object

- folder/file-sync.yml = folder/test.txt

and there is nothing I can do in code to make up for that

### Slashes
You do not need (nor want) leading `/` for the file path on either side of the equal sign

The only time you need `/` trailing is for folder copies. While a file copy will technically still work with a leading `/`, a folder copy will not
